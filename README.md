### Abridged Instructions

Shuffle deck of 40 cards:
* finance (8)
* fuel (10)
* research (10)
* parts (12)

Deal 5 cards each round.
There are a total of 8 rounds.
Each round has 3 turns, consisting of:
* play 1 card face down
* pass the rest left
Thus you will play 3 cards for each round.

In order to build a time machine, you need the following components:
* finance (2)
* fuel (3)
* research (3)
* parts (4)
You cannot build a time machine before round 5.

At the beginning of a round, you may active your time machine by displaying the necessary components.

Before the play phase of a round, a time machine can perform at most 1 of 3 actions:
* destroy all cards from 1 type of component for a given round
* retrieve 1 card from a past round's discard pile
* move 1 card from the current hand into a future round's play area

Each action costs 1 fuel.

Once a time machine is revealed, the fuel requirement is reduced from 3 to 1.

After 8 rounds the winner is the player with a complete time machine.  Ties are broken by the player with the most:
* finance
* fuel
* research
* parts
